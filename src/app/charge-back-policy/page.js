Information may be requested from the bank, payment gateway, biller, or service provider before a decision is made."] },

  { id: "unauthorized", title: "Unauthorized Transactions", paragraphs: ["Users should immediately contact their bank or payment provider and Finunique if they suspect unauthorized activity. Credentials, OTPs, PINs, and passwords must never be shared. Account access may be temporarily restricted to protect the user during investigation."] },
  { id: "misuse", title: "Chargeback Misuse", paragraphs: ["False, duplicate, or malicious chargeback claims may lead to service restrictions and recovery of losses where permitted by law. This does not limit a user’s legitimate rights under applicable consumer or payment laws."] },
