                <>
                    Applicant will fill the PAN Change Request Form online and submit the form.
                    Applicant will initially select a PAN Change Request along with citizenship, category, and title of the applicant, then enter the required details and submit the form. A token number will be generated and displayed to the applicant before filling the form. This token number will also be sent to the registered e-mail ID for reference purposes.

                    <br />
                    There is a facility to save details entered in the application form, allowing the applicant to view and edit before final submission using the temporary token number.
                    Applicant can select any one of the four options while filling the online PAN Change Request application.
                    <br />
                    If the submitted data fails in any format-level validation, an error message will be displayed on the screen. The applicant shall rectify the error(s) and re-submit the form.
                    If there are no format-level errors, a confirmation screen with all data filled by the applicant will be displayed. The applicant may either edit or confirm the same.
                    <br />
                    For Changes or Correction in PAN Data
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2 marker:text-[#0077b6]">
                        <li>Fill all mandatory fields (marked with *) of the form and select the corresponding box on the left margin of the appropriate field where correction is required.</li>
                    </ul>
                    For Re-issuance of PAN Card Without Any Changes

                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2 marker:text-[#0077b6]">
                        <li>Fill all fields in the form but do not select any box on the left margin.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    In both cases, the address for communication will be updated in the Income Tax Department database using the address provided in the application.
                    For Cancellation of PAN
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2 marker:text-[#0077b6]">
                        <li>Fill all mandatory fields in the form, enter the PAN to be cancelled in Item No.10 of the form and select the checkbox on the left margin.</li>
                        <li>The PAN to be cancelled should not be the same as the PAN currently used and mentioned at the top of the form.
                        </li>

                    After confirmation, an acknowledgment screen with a downloadable acknowledgment receipt will be displayed. An e-mail containing this acknowledgment receipt (in PDF format) will also be sent to the applicant’s e-mail ID mentioned in the application.

                    <br />
                    Superscribe the envelope with:
