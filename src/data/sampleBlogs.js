      <p>Online bill payment can save time, but it is important to review the information shown before confirming a transaction. A few simple checks can reduce avoidable mistakes.</p>
      <h2>Keep your bill details ready</h2>
      <p>Use the customer number, account number or consumer ID shown on your latest bill. Enter it carefully and select the correct provider and service area.</p>
      <h2>Review before paying</h2>
      <p>When bill details are fetched, confirm the customer name, billing period, due date and amount. If something looks incorrect, stop and check the details with your provider.</p>
      <h2>Save the transaction reference</h2>
      <p>After payment, keep the confirmation and transaction reference until the provider reflects the payment. Avoid repeating a payment immediately if the status is still processing.</p>

    content: `
      <p>A mobile recharge is usually completed quickly, which makes it especially important to verify the number and plan before payment.</p>
      <h2>Check the mobile number</h2>
      <p>Read the number again before continuing. A successful recharge sent to the wrong number may not be reversible.</p>
      <h2>Confirm operator and circle</h2>
      <p>Make sure the detected or selected operator and service circle match the mobile connection. If the number was recently ported, verify the current operator.</p>
      <h2>Read the plan details</h2>
      <p>Compare validity, data, calls and other benefits. Plan availability and benefits are controlled by the operator and may change.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Digital payments are convenient, but safe habits remain essential. Always pause when a message or caller pressures you to act immediately.</p>
      <h2>Keep OTPs and credentials private</h2>
      <p>Never share an OTP, password, PIN or card security code with another person. Genuine support teams should not ask for these details.</p>
      <h2>Use trusted access points</h2>
      <p>Open Finunique through the official website or app. Avoid unknown links received through messages, advertisements or social media.</p>
      <h2>Review transaction alerts</h2>
      <p>Check bank alerts and account activity. If you notice an unfamiliar transaction, contact your bank and Finunique support promptly.</p>
